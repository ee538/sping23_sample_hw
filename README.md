- Q1 will help you to understand the file organization under the `bazel` build system.
- Q2 is to show you how to step through to find the error in your code. Currently the code doesn't give a correct result and is hard for us to find the issue by just looking at it. Debug is an crucial skill that you have to learn.
- Q3 is an example of modern C++ (not so modern, though). Besides the basic syntax of C++, you should also learn to use the standard library and operations that are a very important part of C++.
- Q4 is an example of functional programming. It enables you to split the `data and logics` so that your code will be easy to maintain though the `data` here are also some logics, or we should call them predicates or policy filters.
